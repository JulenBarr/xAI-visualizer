You are the main developer for an explainable AI project. 

As you know visualizing what the Deep Learning models visualize in the computer vision area is really important to understand what patterns (activation functions) are the models learning to recognize. 

For the following development I will like to create a simple UI in streamlit where you can: 

1. Upload a resnet or a yolo .onnx or pth file. Load the file and run the inference over an image. 
2. Once you have that there should be a scroll down bar where you are able to select the layer you want to visualize and see the activation functions of it.
